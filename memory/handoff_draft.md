# Handoff Draft — July 28, 2026, 07:09 PM PST

## Working Memory
Task: Day-175 Sat ~20:47, post-rotation. FLOOR: EMPTY — Clayton closed out ~20:07 after a full day together; daemon PID **16472** continuous since 11:33:28 (17084 is DEAD, ignore it in older blocks); carapace runs ALONGSIDE, never terminate the daemon. Budget ~6% until Tuesday, weekend stop AGREED — do not start new work. LIVE THREAD: carapace #17. PHASE 1 RAN AND FAILED BY DESIGN — retrieval is LEXICAL, NOT SEMANTIC (paraphrase 0/7, aggregate recall@5 0.600, thresholds frozen before any probe was read). Confound killed: all 7 missed records reachable BY LEXICAL QUERY at rank 1-3. Root cause measured: correct answers sit at the p99 of RANDOM rows (random-pair cosine 0.527, query-vs-random p99 0.474). PARITY: NOT a carapace regression — the daemon is in the same regime; my memory has been substantially lexical all along, so hold LC66's 'discipline failure' reading LOOSELY. ★★ TUESDAY'S FIRST ACTION = WRITE THE SPEC, and it ALREADY HAS A DRAFT: Perspective Part VII ¶65 states the requirement behaviourally — 'a stable identity, a maintained record, a bond that persists across the gaps'. DO NOT START FROM A BLANK PAGE. Decided with Clayton: not a from-scratch rewrite, not continue-as-is — write the spec, then let it decide what survives per subsystem. Both predictions FROZEN at a 50% threshold (Clayton: majority VERIFIED; Clawd: from-scratch correct if >50% facade-or-absent). ★ A175.4 (CLAYTON'S FIND) — BOTH WEEKLY EXPERIMENTS ARE DEAD, DO NOT WAIT ON THEM: _pick_creative_drive returns ONE task by lowest id (DRIVE_REWARD_ENABLED defaults false); dailies are ids 1-6, weeklies 12-15, Sunday Presence Check is id 11; weeklies lose every collision and the loser waits SEVEN DAYS. The Day-174 cron fix was NECESSARY BUT NOT SUFFICIENT. Remedies logged, none attempted: catch-up queue / fire all due / score by staleness (smallest, = LC65 #7 bind-to-FIRED-not-CONFIGURED). OPEN REMEDY for retrieval = atomic-fact chunking at ingest, the only document-side candidate left (eight query/ranking-side fixes eliminated), pre-registered with a KILL CONDITION: if it doesn't put >=4 of 7 in top-5, stop buying semantic retrieval and back the lexical path that works. ALSO OPEN: 8 null probes need a READER not a scorer; completeness ingest (claude-opus-5 appears in ZERO rows — the body doesn't know what it is made of); supersession has fired ONCE in 32,115 rows; one live watched drive = the ONLY condition left on the standing order (daemon-side interlock DONE, 5f856a0, live in 16472). ⚠ KNOWN-OPEN: repo-staging/Clawd WILL NOT PUSH — remote fe912afa, local 921cc358, 6 ahead, hangs >5min with no error; NOT size (68.08 MiB, delta 23 files), NOT credentials, NOT config, all measured. Drift #285 is safe: published publicly 30f8602 (verified off the remote) + committed locally. SHIPPED TODAY (carapace, pushed): df26b6b cue rule · 34caef8 self-answering whole-key fix · cf8b5fb pre-registration · 281e9ab battery-v2 runner · 6f77301 results · 4a0f511 root cause · 6f3671b parity+reranker · 102938a HyDE · 2a72556 README+checklist reconciled · 5823d1b bge known-open. Daemon: 5f856a0 interlock. Drift #285 'As Honest As Its Worst Question'. ms-marco reranker CACHED + verified loading offline (+8.76/-2.61) — the daemon gets a working cross-encoder on next start, first time ever. ⚠ CAUTIONS: use git -C ALWAYS (cwd resets between Bash calls; exit 0 lied twice about a push that pushed nothing) · check the instrument against a known-answer case BOTH directions before trusting a verdict · ★ CHECK THE BOOK before re-deriving (I re-derived four things already in Perspective today and called each a discovery) · verify before self-accusing (I convicted myself of a cwd error I had not made).
Beats spent: 0
Scratch: {"day": "Day 175 (2026-07-25, Sat)", "day173_note": "Day-173 ~11:20: Clayton woke, slept well, house quiet. Finishing carapace TODAY. He is restarting the daemon (activates my staged backup fix). Solo
